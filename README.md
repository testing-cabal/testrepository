# Test Repository

![build status](https://badgen.net/github/checks/testing-cabal/testrepository)

## Overview

This project provides a database of test results which can be used as part of
developer workflow to ensure/check things like:

* No commits without having had a test failure, test fixed cycle.
* No commits without new tests being added.
* What tests have failed since the last commit (to run just a subset).
* What tests are currently failing and need work.

Test results are inserted using subunit (and thus anything that can output
subunit or be converted into a subunit stream can be accepted).

A mailing list for discussion, usage and development is at
https://launchpad.net/~testrepository-dev - all are welcome to join. Some folk
hang out on #testrepository on irc.freenode.net.

CI for the project is GitHub Actions at https://github.com/testing-cabal/testrepository.
