"""Storage of test results.

A Repository provides storage and indexing of results.

The AbstractRepository class defines the contract to which any Repository
implementation must adhere.

The file submodule is the usual repository that code will use for local
access, and the memory submodule provides a memory only repository useful for
testing.

Repositories are identified by their URL, and new ones are made by calling
the initialize function in the appropriate repository module.
