"""'Commands' for testr.

The code in this module contains the Command base class, the run_argv
entry point to run CLI commands.

Actual commands can be found in testrepository.commands.$commandname.

For example, testrepository.commands.init is the init command name, and
testrepository.command.show_stats would be the show-stats command (if one
existed). The Command discovery logic looks for a class in the module with
the same name - e.g. tesrepository.commands.init.init would be the class.
That class must obey the testrepository.commands.Command protocol, but does
not need to be a subclass.

Plugins and extensions wanting to add commands should install them into
testrepository.commands (perhaps by extending the testrepository.commands
__path__ to include a directory containing their commands - no __init__ is
needed in that directory.)

    Commands contain non-UI non-domain specific behaviour - they are the

        arguments, input and output. There is no default ui, it must be
        passed to the constructor.

    :ivar repository_factory: a repository factory which is used to create or
        open repositories. The default repository factory is suitable for
        use in the command line tool.

    :ivar args: A list of testrepository.arguments.AbstractArgument instances.
        AbstractArgument arguments are validated when set_command is called on
        the UI layer.

        are specified by a simple name. Optional streams are specified by
        a simple name with a ? ending the name. Optional multiple streams are
        specified by a simple name with a * ending the name, and mandatory
        multiple streams by ending the name with +. Multiple streams are used
